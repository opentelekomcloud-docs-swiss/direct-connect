Introduction
============

Welcome to Direct Connect API Reference. Direct Connect allows you to connect your on-premises data center to the cloud over a dedicated network connection that features stable performance, high transmission speed, low network latency, and secure data transmission. Direct Connect allows you to maximize legacy IT facilities and leverage cloud services to build a flexible, scalable hybrid cloud computing environment.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on Direct Connect resources, such as creating, querying, modifying, or deleting connections. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0055025301>`.

Before you access Direct Connect by calling APIs, get yourself familiar with product concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in *Direct Connect User Guide*.
