Process Description
===================

Establish network connectivity to enable ECSs in your VPC to communicate with your data center or private network.

To do so, you first need to apply for a connection to reserve the port used to connect your on-premises data center to the Direct Connect location you select. After that, create a virtual gateway and associate it with a VPC, and finally create a virtual interface to connect to the VPC.

For details, see :ref:`Establishing Network Connectivity <dc_02_0202__li1651169191118>`.

:ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0125230102__fig1512373212493>` shows the whole process for connecting your on-premises data center to the cloud.
